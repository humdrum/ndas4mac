Thank you for buying the IOCELL Networks NetDISK.

The current NDAS-Software version does not support Multi-User Write access. Writing from multiple computers may corrupt the data stored in the TrekStor DataStation.

After starting NDAS Utility in "/Applications/Utilities" directory, you can register the NetDISK by pressing Register Tool Bar Icon, or Register a new Device in the Management Menu. Once you've registered "Disk ID" and "Write Key", you don't need to type in those IDs again.

The NetDISK's standard file system is FAT32. If the NetDISK should be NTFS formatted, you may need to go through initialization process to partition and reformat the disk into a Mac OS Extended file system or other file systems that Mac OS-X can access. After this one-time initialization process, you will see the NetDISK on your desktop.
