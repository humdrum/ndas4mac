Thank you for trying NDAS OS-X version.

The current version do not support Multi-User Write access. Writing from multiple computers may corrupt the data stored in the NDAS.

First time users who are connecting NTFS formatted NDAS may need to go through initialization process to partition and reformat the disk into a Mac OS Extended file system or other file systems that Mac OS-X can access. After this one-time initialization process, you will see the NDAS on your desktop.

After starting NDAS Utility in "/Applications/Utilities" directory, You can register the NDAS by pressing Register Tool Bar Icon, or Register a New Device Menu in the Management Menu. Once you've registered "Disk ID" and "Write Key", you don't need to type in those IDs again.
