Thank you for using ShareDisk.

I. Current version
The current version of ShareDisk Software is version 1.6.6 for Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger) for PPC and Intel Macs and 1.6.6 for Mac OS 10.3 (Tiger) for PPC Macs.

II. Requirements
- PPC Mac with Mac OS 10.3 (Panther) or Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger)
- PPC or Intel Mac with Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger)

III. Limitations
The current version of ShareDisk Software for Mac OS X does not support simultaneous Multi-User Write access. Writing from multiple computers may corrupt the data stored in the ShareDisk.

Users who mount ShareDisks formatted with NTFS the first time may need to go through the process of initialization, partitioning and reformat the disk into a Mac OS X Extended file system or other file systems that Mac OS X can access with the inherent possibility of data loss.

IV. Using ShareDisk Device Manager
After starting ShareDisk Device Manager in "/Applications/Utilities" directory, you can register a ShareDisk by pressing the Register Tool Bar Icon, or Register a New Device Menu in the Management Menu. 

Once you've registered "ShareDisk ID" and "Write Key", you don't need to type in those IDs again.
