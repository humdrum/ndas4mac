
Thank you for trying GenDisk OS-X version.

The current version do not support Multi-User Write access. Writing from multiple computers may corrupt the data stored in the GenDisk.

First time users who are connecting NTFS formatted GenDisk(factory default) may need to go through initialization process to partition and reformat the disk into a Mac OS Extended file system or other file systems that Mac OS-X can access. After this one-time initialization process, you will see the GenDisk on your desktop.

After starting NDAdmin in "/Applications" directory, please type in "GenDisk ID" and "Write Key" on the bottom of the GenDisk and click "Add" button. Once you've added "GenDiskID" and "Write Key", you don't need to type in those IDs again.
