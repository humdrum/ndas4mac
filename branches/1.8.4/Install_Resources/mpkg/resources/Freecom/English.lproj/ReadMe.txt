
Thank you for trying the Freecom Network Drive OS-X version driver.

The current version does not support Multi-User Write access. Writing from multiple computers may corrupt the data stored on the Network Drive.

First time users who are connecting NTFS formatted Network Drives (standard) may need to go through initialization process to partition and reformat the disk into a Mac OS Extended file system or other file systems that Mac OS-X can access. After this one-time initialization process, you will see the drive on your desktop.

After starting the Freecom NDAS Utility in "/Applications/Utilities" directory, please type in "NDAS ID" and "Write Key" which can be found on the bottom of the Network Drive and click the "Add" button. Once you've added the "Disk ID" and "Write Key", you don't need to type in those IDs again.
