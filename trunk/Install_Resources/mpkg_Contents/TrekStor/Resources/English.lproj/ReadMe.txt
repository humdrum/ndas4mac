Thank you for bying the DataStation maxi z.ul.

The current NDAS-Software version do not support Multi-User Write access. Writing from multiple computers may corrupt the data stored in the DataStation maxi z.ul.

After starting NDAS Utility in "/Applications/Utilities" directory, you can register the DataStation maxi z.ul by pressing Register Tool Bar Icon, or Register a new Device in the Management Menu. Once you've registered "Disk ID" and "Write Key", you don't need to type in those IDs again.

The DataStation maxi z.ul's standard file system is FAT32. If the DataStation maxi z.ul should be NTFS formatted, you may need to go through initialization process to partition and reformat the disk into a Mac OS Extended file system or other file systems that Mac OS-X can access. After this one-time initialization process, you will see the NetDisk on your desktop.
